Description: Evaluation of the pdf and the cdf of the univariate,
        noncentral, p-generalized normal distribution. Sampling from
        the univariate, noncentral, p-generalized normal distribution
        using either the p-generalized polar method, the p-generalized
        rejecting polar method, the Monty Python method, the Ziggurat
        method or the method of Nardon and Pianca. The package also
        includes routines for the simulation of the bivariate,
        p-generalized uniform distribution and the simulation of the
        corresponding angular distribution.
